# Assignment 3 Part 1
## Project description
The ErcAssignmentToken project is an implementation of an ERC20-compliant token using the Solidity programming language. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, the project extends the basic ERC20 functionality by introducing a transaction logging system. This allows users and developers to track transaction details such as sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp.
## Functionality
### The projects functionality is based on the following functions:
+ getTransaction() - retrieve transaction information
+ getLatestTransactionTimestamp() - get the block timestamp of the latest transaction
+ getLatestTransactionSender() - retrieve the sender of the latest transaction
+ getLatestTransactionReceiver() - retrieve the receiver of the latest transaction
+ transfer() - override transfer function to log transactions
